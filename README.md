# Welcome to Curvit!

Hi!  **Curvit** is an open source python package to produce lightcurves from **UVIT (Ultraviolet imaging Telescope)** data.  The events file from the **official UVIT L2 pipeline** is required as in input to the package.  **Other pipeline products** are not yet supported (*but do mail me about your requirement, we can figure something out!*).
